      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>SREAT is a rare autoimmune neurological condition that is known to present with various neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neurological symptoms frequently reported include seizures, stroke-like episodes, ataxia, tremors, confusion, speech disturbances, cerebellar signs, dementia, and varying levels of consciousness ranging from drowsiness to coma. Neuropsychiatric manifestations encompass a broad spectrum, including sleep disturbances, mood disorders, depression, manic delirium, paranoia, hallucinations, and catatonia. Key differentials include stroke and transient ischemic attack, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis. Other considerations include multiple sclerosis, hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and myxedema madness (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The diagnosis consists of exceptionally elevated levels of antithyroid antibodies with the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis of SREAT should only be considered when other differentials have been ruled out in cases of patients with a history of hypothyroidism, irrespective of the presenting thyroid status, even if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings may be inconclusive (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Most patients are euthyroid, which makes the diagnosis challenging. The association between the encephalopathy and antithyroid antibodies remains ambiguous (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Glucocorticoids remain the primary treatment of choice (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Other immunosuppressive agents like intravenous immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis have been used in non-responders to steroid therapy cases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The disease can manifest with varying durations, including acute, subacute, or chronic phases (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Here, we present a clinical case of a 54-year-old lady who presented as a hypertensive emergency with stroke-like symptoms along with some other atypical neurological findings and, on workup, was diagnosed to be SREAT and responded to a pulse dose of glucocorticoid therapy.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>A female patient, age 54, arrived at the casualty section with symptoms of confusion, twitching of the face and tongue, trouble speaking, weakness in all four limbs, and one episode of non-projectile, non-bilious vomiting that contained food particles. She was a known case of hypothyroidism for four months and systemic hypertension for 5 months, taking the tablet Levothyroxine 25 microgram (mcg) once daily (OD) for the last four months and the tablet Telmisartan 20 milligram (mg) OD for the previous five months respectively.</p>
      <p>On clinical examination, her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 14 E<sub>4</sub>V<sub>4</sub>M<sub>6</sub>. Her pulse was 122 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 200/110 millimetres of mercury (mm Hg). Her respiratory rate was 16 cycles per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% in room air. Her temperature was 36.4&#xB0;C.</p>
      <p>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 24/30 during a neurological evaluation. Pupils were bilaterally symmetrical and reactive to light. Her power was 2/5 in her right and left lower limbs and 4/5 in her right and left upper limbs, according to Medical Research Council (MRC) scaling. Her plantars were flexors, but all her deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated. Myoclonus was observed in the facial muscles and tongue. There was no sensory neuro-deficit. Other Systemic examinations were within normal limits. A fundal examination revealed normal fundus.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>SREAT is known to have various manifestations. These include neurological conditions, neuropsychiatric conditions, and some nonspecific symptoms. The neurological symptoms typically include seizures, stroke-like phenomena, ataxia, tremors, confusion, speech disturbances, cerebellar manifestations, dementia, various levels of consciousness from drowsiness, stupor, coma, and other atypical phenomena like myelopathy, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease-like symptoms (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The neuropsychiatric manifestations include sleep disturbances, mood disturbances, depression, manic delirium, paranoia, hallucinations (both audio and visual), and catatonia (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Other nonspecific manifestations include headaches, fever, and generalized weakness. Our case had an atypical presentation of hypertensive urgency with stroke-like and myoclonic symptoms.</p>
      <p>When each of the six criteria listed below is met, a diagnosis can be made (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>):</p>

      <p>Our patient met the above criteria and hence was diagnosed to be SREAT.</p>
      <sec id="s6_1">
        <title>Pathogenesis</title>
        <p>Since the initial case report of SREAT in 1966, there has been no conclusive theory regarding the pathophysiology of this autoimmune encephalopathy (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Since this disease&#x2019;s initial description, scientists have emphasized that it may simply be a comorbid combination of a rare and unknown autoimmune brain disease with a well-known, widely distributed illness called Hashimoto&#x2019;s autoimmune thyroiditis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The hallmark feature consistent throughout the available literature is the association between encephalopathy and the presence of high titers of antithyroid antibodies. Anti-TPO antibodies are usually above 900 IU/ml (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), as seen in our patient. This entity remains the most common feature. SREAT is not a direct result of changes in the thyroid status in the central nervous system; instead, it is an immune-mediated illness. This hypothesis can be supported by many factors: The disease is known to respond to immunosuppressive therapy, which may indicate some underlying autoimmune or inflammatory condition (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It has been proposed that elevated thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has a deleterious effect on the central nervous system. The observation of clinical improvement with hormonal treatment reducing TRH secretion solely despite euthyroid status showed a harmful effect of TRH (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
        <p>An alternative theory suggests that a cross-reactive autoantigen in the thyroid and brain is probably the source of SREAT. One such contender that has been studied is protein disulfide-isomerase A3. One case series describes the presence of antithyroid antibodies and circulating immune complexes (CICs) in the CSF of patients with SREAT. Uncertainty surrounds the pathogenetic involvement of autoantibodies and CIC. Immune complexes can be formed when CSF autoantibodies react with a potential CNS antigen (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The most significant discovery in autoimmune Hashimoto&#x2019;s encephalopathy (HE) over recent decades is the identification of autoantibodies against the N-terminal of alpha-enolase (aNAE) in many cases. Japanese researchers first reported high aNAE seropositivity in HE (60-83%) and demonstrated its role through proteome analysis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s6_2">
        <title>Case discussion</title>
        <p>In the presented case, a patient with atypical neurological symptoms was initially suspected to have a stroke based on clinical history and presenting complaints. However, a comprehensive physical examination ruled out a stroke. The patient&#x2019;s blood pressure, recorded at 200/110 mmHg, was managed with an intravenous bolus of labetalol (20 mg), achieving a controlled reduction to 180/100 mmHg. Upon presentation, blood glucose levels were assessed and found to be within the normal range, effectively excluding hypoglycemia as a contributing factor.</p>
        <p>To investigate potential underlying demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis or other brain pathologies, an MRI was performed, revealing inconclusive findings apart from nonspecific chronic small vessel ischemic changes, which were considered clinically insignificant in the context of the patient&#x2019;s presentation. Additional investigations, including fundoscopic examination and MRI imaging, showed no evidence of raised intracranial pressure, encephalitis, or other structural abnormalities, effectively excluding posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Additionally, liver and renal function tests were within normal limits, ruling out hepatic and uremic encephalopathy as potential etiologies.</p>
        <p>Given the persistent neurological symptoms, a differential diagnosis of infectious meningoencephalitis was considered, and CSF analysis was performed with markers for viral meningitis and tuberculosis; however, the findings were inconclusive, hence viral, bacterial, tubercular, or any other infectious meningoencephalitis was excluded as potential differential diagnosis. Subsequently, autoimmune encephalitis was suspected, and specific autoimmune markers were evaluated, all of which returned negative, effectively ruling out this possibility.</p>
        <p>Despite achieving controlled blood pressure reduction, the patient&#x2019;s symptoms did not improve, and there was progressive neurological deterioration. Furthermore, the absence of hypertensive encephalopathy was confirmed by the lack of characteristic MRI findings, retinal changes, and the clinical course.</p>
        <p>Given the patient&#x2019;s history of hypothyroidism, myxedema madness was considered but ruled out due to normal thyroid function tests. At this juncture, after excluding all other differentials, a presumptive diagnosis of SREAT was made. Anti-TPO antibody levels were markedly elevated (&gt;1000 IU/mL), supporting the diagnosis. The generalized slowing observed on the EEG was consistent with SREAT.</p>
        <p>The patient was initiated on intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, to which there was a dramatic clinical response, further confirming the diagnosis of SREAT.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s6_3">
        <title>Treatment</title>
        <p>Treatment modalities for SREAT include immunosuppression using corticosteroids as the first-line therapy. This remedy is highly effective; most patients (approximately 90%) showed a partial or complete neurological response (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). There is no consensus on the exact amount of corticosteroid usage and the duration of the treatment. It differs from patient to patient, as well as the clinical response to corticosteroids. The length of symptoms before beginning treatment does not relate to the outcome. Within one to three days, individuals experiencing acute or subacute severe impairment of consciousness (stupor, coma) showed the fastest clinical improvement after starting steroid treatment (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Usually, the treatment begins as a pulse dose of injectable methyl-prednisolone (MPS) (500mg &#x2013; 1g OD) for 3-7 days. The duration of treatment and need for an oral steroid dose are generally titrated according to the clinical response. Prednisone (50&#x2013;150 mg daily, or 1&#x2013;2 mg/kg/d) is recommended as an oral steroid (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The corticosteroid treatment duration and taper rate should be changed based on the clinical response.</p>
        <p>The patient was administered intravenous MPS at 500 mg once daily for three consecutive days, resulting in a marked clinical improvement. A rapid recovery of neurological deficits was observed, with significant restoration of consciousness noted following the first dose. By completing the treatment regimen, the patient&#x2019;s symptoms had fully resolved. Concurrently, a structured physiotherapy program was implemented, contributing to accelerating her overall recovery process.</p>
        <p>Thyroid hormones play a dual role, functioning as replacement therapy and non-steroidal immunomodulators while also suppressing hyperprolactinemia, a condition that may exacerbate autoimmune activity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Patients with autoimmune thyroid disorders may require periodic adjustments to their thyroid hormone replacement therapy. These dose modifications are necessitated by the dynamic nature of the underlying autoimmune process, which can influence thyroid gland function over time. Adjusting thyroid hormone dosage should be guided by regularly monitoring serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels to ensure optimal therapeutic efficacy and minimize the risk of under- or overtreatment. In this case, no titration of levothyroxine therapy was necessary, as the patient&#x2019;s thyroid function tests, including serum TSH, FT4, and FT3 levels, were within normal ranges at admission and during subsequent follow-up assessments.</p>
        <p>In resistant cases of SREAT, some authors recommend combining corticosteroids with other immunosuppressants like azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and rituximab (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A promising second line of treatment involves intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) injections, effective even as a first-line therapy in patients with obesity-related metabolic concerns (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Plasmapheresis has also been successful in steroid non-responders or those worsening after corticosteroids, likely by removing specific autoantibodies or inflammatory mediators from the blood (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).Though theoretically effective, cerebrospinal fluid adsorption has not yet been tested for treating SREAT (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>

        <title>Take-away message</title>
        <p>Thus, to summarize, Steroid Responsive Encephalopathy Associated with Autoimmune Thyroiditis (SREAT), also referred to as Hashimoto&#x2019;s encephalopathy (HE), is an autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by encephalopathy accompanied by raised levels of antithyroid antibodies. The pathophysiology of SREAT remains a mystery and often presents a diagnostic challenge. Typically, it is a diagnosis of exclusion. In our case report, we discuss the case of a middle-aged hypothyroid female patient who presented with a Hypertensive emergency along with a constellation of atypical neurological signs and symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with SREAT and responded to injectable corticosteroids. This report highlights the importance of high clinical suspicion and early diagnosis in ascertaining this condition.</p>

      <title>Patient perspective</title>
      <p>I was taking my medications for hypothyroidism and high blood pressure regularly, but one day, an unexpected turn of events occurred, and things took a turn for the worse. I became confused, had facial twitching, was unable to stand, and was also not able to properly hold objects. I was rushed to the hospital, where many tests were done. I do not remember what happened to&#xA0;me for the next 2-3 days in the intensive care unit (ICU). After the treatment, I regained my mental clarity and felt strength returning to my limbs. When I became fully conscious, the doctors explained to me that I had suffered from SREAT, a rare autoimmune brain condition that happens only in hypothyroid patients, and also that now I was out of danger. They advised me to follow up every 15 days to check for recurrence. I&#x2019;m grateful for the swift diagnosis and effective treatment, which allowed me to return to my everyday life with no residual symptoms. I hope my story can help others understand the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for this condition and its impact on one&#x2019;s recovery.</p>
